            <h2>Daniel Okeke – A Passionate Innovator in IT and Mobile Repairs</h2>
            <p>Born in Lagos, Nigeria, my journey into the world of technology began long before I could fully understand it. In 2009, I moved to the United States, where I was introduced to a rapidly evolving digital landscape that both challenged and inspired me. It was here that I discovered my passion for solving problems through technology, leading me to pursue a career in IT and mobile device repairs.

As a senior at Bowie State University, I’m working towards a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Technology with a focus on Network Enterprise Infrastructure. I’ve always believed that technology has the power to transform lives, and I strive to be at the forefront of this transformation by equipping myself with the skills and knowledge needed to make a meaningful impact.

In 2017, I founded The Mobile DOC, a business built on the idea that fast, reliable, and affordable repairs should be accessible to everyone. From humble beginnings servicing a close-knit community to building a consistent customer base, I’ve handled hundreds of successful repairs, helping clients get back to the devices they rely on every day. This business not only allowed me to refine my technical abilities but also taught me the importance of customer service, time management, and effective multitasking across various roles and responsibilities.</p>

These roles have sharpened my technical abilities and reinforced my commitment to delivering solutions that work for both individual users and large organizations.

In my role, I troubleshoot hardware, software, and network-related issues, ensuring fast and efficient resolutions while adhering to strict SLAs. I manage service desk tickets using ServiceNow, research and implement solutions, and escalate complex issues to Tier III teams when necessary. My experience here has greatly enhanced my problem-solving skills, particularly in diagnosing network and telecommunication systems issues.

Teksystems – IT Contractor (October 2021 – January 2023)
At Teksystems, I gained valuable experience in various IT support roles, including as a PC Deployment Technician and an IT Support Specialist. During my time with Trinity Health Systems and Exelon Holdings, I was responsible for system upgrades, hardware troubleshooting, and machine imaging to ensure seamless transitions during system migrations. Additionally, I developed strong Junior System Administration skills, where I managed device deployments, software installations, and network configurations to meet enterprise-level demands.

My Cellphone Repairs – Mobile Technician / Engineer (November 2019 – November 2021)
In this role, I handled a wide variety of tasks, including customer service, inventory management, and, most importantly, mobile device repairs. I specialized in troubleshooting both hardware and software issues for mobile phones, tablets, and computers, achieving a 98% success rate in repairs. I also handled communication between clients and telecommunication companies, ensuring that all repairs and services met client expectations. This role allowed me to develop advanced knowledge of repair techniques, including screen replacements, button repairs, and system reprogramming, while running the operational side of the business.
